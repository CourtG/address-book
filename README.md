Tech Challenge
========

A simple web form that links to a user database and can perform basic CRUD oprtations.

Using node.js, Express, React, and mySQL (and then postgres!).

Axios calls were used to send and receive (GET, POST) HTTP requests to the server

NOTE: yaml script included and init.sql file containing the sample data

Although I have very limited back-end knowledge, I used the skills I have as a developer to attempt to learn the back-end that I needed to make this app run. I have used Firebase, but wanted to try using the frameworks used at the company.

I learned a lot in the process, but still wasn't able to populate the database with the sample data. Because of this, I wasn't able to confirm the update and delete buttons worked, or apply styling. 



Features
--------

- input form to CREATE user profiles
- "show users" button to READ or display users
- UPDATE input fields
- DELETE button for deleting user data

- minor error handling
- minimal CSS


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
